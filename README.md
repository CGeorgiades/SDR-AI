 Basic nerual network trained using the MNIST dataset
 
 Requires python 3, and the following pip packages [MNIST](https://pypi.org/project/python-mnist/) and [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
 
 Additionally, ensure tkinter is available on your system
 
 To train the network, run `trainNet.py`. You may specify at the command line what file name it should output to, otherwise it defaults to simply "Net". If the file passed is already a network, then it will train starting with that network
